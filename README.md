# GAIA-Q-UI Traceability Matrix

## Overview

This document provides bidirectional traceability between system requirements, high-level requirements, low-level requirements, source code, and test cases for the GAIA-Q-UI system. This traceability is essential for demonstrating compliance with DO-178C objectives.

## Traceability Structure

The traceability matrix uses the following ID formats:

- **System Requirements**: SR-XXX
- **High-Level Requirements**: HLR-XXX
- **Low-Level Requirements**: LLR-XXX-YYY (where XXX corresponds to the parent HLR)
- **Source Code**: SC-XXX-YYY (where XXX-YYY corresponds to the implemented LLR)
- **Test Cases**: TC-XXX-YYY (where XXX-YYY corresponds to the tested requirement)
