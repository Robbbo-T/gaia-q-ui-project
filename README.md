2. Component interactions
3. Data flow descriptions
4. Technology stack details



2. **AToC Integration Guide**

1. How GAIA-Q-UI implements the AToC framework
2. Document structure and metadata requirements
3. INFOCODE-INDEX usage guidelines
4. Cut point optimization details



3. **Compliance Documentation**

1. DO-178C/DO-254 compliance approach
2. Traceability matrix templates
3. Certification artifact guidelines
4. Regulatory framework mappings



4. **User Guides**

1. Getting started tutorials
2. Feature-specific guides
3. Integration walkthroughs
4. Troubleshooting information



5. **API Documentation**

1. REST/GraphQL API references
2. Integration endpoints
3. Authentication methods
4. Rate limiting and usage guidelines


Which documentation file would you like to prioritize? Here’s a quick breakdown of the options:

1. **Generate architecture overview**: A detailed visual and textual explanation of the system's architecture, including components, data flow, and interactions.

2. **Create AToC integration guide**: A step-by-step guide for integrating the project with the Aerospace Technical Operating Concept (AToC) framework.

3. **Develop compliance documentation**: Documentation to meet regulatory standards like DO-178C, DO-254, or other aerospace compliance frameworks.

4. **Generate user guides**: Easy-to-follow instructions for end-users to navigate and utilize the key features of the system.

5. **Create API documentation**: Comprehensive documentation for developers to understand, integrate, and extend the APIs provided by the system.

Let me know which one you’d like me to develop further!
