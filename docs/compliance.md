# GAIA-Q-UI Traceability Matrix

## Overview

This document provides bidirectional traceability between system requirements, high-level requirements, low-level requirements, source code, and test cases for the GAIA-Q-UI system. This traceability is essential for demonstrating compliance with DO-178C objectives.

## Traceability Structure

The traceability matrix uses the following ID formats:

- **System Requirements**: SR-XXX
- **High-Level Requirements**: HLR-XXX
- **Low-Level Requirements**: LLR-XXX-YYY (where XXX corresponds to the parent HLR)
- **Source Code**: SC-XXX-YYY (where XXX-YYY corresponds to the implemented LLR)
- **Test Cases**: TC-XXX-YYY (where XXX-YYY corresponds to the tested requirement)

4. **User Guides**

1. Getting started tutorials
2. Feature-specific guides
3. Integration walkthroughs
4. Troubleshooting information



5. **API Documentation**

1. REST/GraphQL API references
2. Integration endpoints
3. Authentication methods
4. Rate limiting and usage guidelines


Which documentation file would you like to prioritize? Here’s a quick breakdown of the options:

1. **Generate architecture overview**: A detailed visual and textual explanation of the system's architecture, including components, data flow, and interactions.

2. **Create AToC integration guide**: A step-by-step guide for integrating the project with the Aerospace Technical Operating Concept (AToC) framework.

3. **Develop compliance documentation**: Documentation to meet regulatory standards like DO-178C, DO-254, or other aerospace compliance frameworks.

4. **Generate user guides**: Easy-to-follow instructions for end-users to navigate and utilize the key features of the system.

5. **Create API documentation**: Comprehensive documentation for developers to understand, integrate, and extend the APIs provided by the system.

Let me know which one you’d like me to develop further!
